> This is also true in type theory, but because types might be more structured than sets are, an expression containing a free variable does not merely describe a function (between sets), but a morphism (between types). One way to think of this is that the “elements” of a type act more like generalized elements in category theory. Another way to think of it is that we should be able to “substitute” for a variable not just the “values” in its domain in the naive sense (e.g. the elements of the underlying set of a group), but also whatever structure there may be relating those values, to ensure that the “morphism” defined by any expression preserves that structure.
