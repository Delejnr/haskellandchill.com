# Not Software Craftsmanship

> We politely inquired of these white-smocked workers exactly what they were doing. "We're craftsmen, proof of our company's dedication to quality," they replied. (1)

We care about quality, but there are many ways to approach quality. An individual craftsperson can toil on an object of high quality; a team of craftspeople can specialize and colloborate, using apprenticenship to guide newcomers into their craft, and agile methods to work together; or we can move the crafting relation to a higher level and examine the means of production, the relation between working capacity and supply, the ability to define and measure properties of our process, like defect rates, and use them as guidance for improvement. This is scientification of craft.
