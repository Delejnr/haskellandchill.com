# Naming

Descriptive definitions, not quite
Reference to environment, just ok
break apart self reference step by step to avoid paradoxical situations
Mu operator, yes 

# Fixpoints, the science of recursion

```
fix : (a -> a) -> a
```

The tautological defintion

```
fix f = f (fix f)
```

surprisingly works

# Order and Recursion
