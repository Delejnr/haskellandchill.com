# Terms

Here we clarify basic terminology, mainly about functions, sets, etc.

# Functions

Functions have a domain and codomain, we aim to use this terminology exclusively and never mention range, corange, or what have you.
Functions are written in lower case with the domain and codomain named based on context like `f : D -> C`. We should be comfortable thinking
of functions as tables, ie ordered pairs `(d,c)` or more mechanicially as proofs, ie given `d` I can constrcut a `c` by some procedure.
